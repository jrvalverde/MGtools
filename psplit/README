NAME
       psplit - split a file into pieces

SYNOPSIS
       psplit [-b bytes[k|m] | -L regex | -l lines | -lines] [-a suffixlength]
              [file [name]]

DESCRIPTION
       Psplit reads file and writes it in 1000-line pieces as many  as  neces-
       sary, onto a set of output files.  The name of the first output file is
       name with aa appended, and so on lexicographically.  If no output  name
       is given, x is default.

       If  no  input  file  is  given, or if - is given in its stead, then the
       standard input file is used.

       The following options (all of them introduced by POSIX.2) are accepted:

       -a suffixlength Use suffixlength characters for the  appended  part  of
                       the output file name different for each file instead of
                       2 (using a suffixlength of 3 will  create  files  named
                       xaaa-xzzz, and so forth).

       -b n[k|m]       Split  the file in pieces of n bytes each.  If k is ap-
                       pended, n is taken in kilobyte (1024-byte) units;  with
                       m, in megabyte units.

       -l n            Split the file in pieces of n lines each.

       -L regex        Only  count lines containing the stated regular expres-
                       sion (non-POSIX).
