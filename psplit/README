       _P_s_p_l_i_t reads _f_i_l_e and writes it in 1000-line pieces as many  as  neces‐
       sary, onto a set of output files.  The name of the first output file is
       _n_a_m_e with _a_a appended, and so on lexicographically.  If no output  name
       is given, xx is default.

       If  no  input  file  is  given, or if -- is given in its stead, then the
       standard input file is used.

       The following options (all of them introduced by POSIX.2) are accepted:

       --aa _s_u_f_f_i_x_l_e_n_g_t_h Use _s_u_f_f_i_x_l_e_n_g_t_h characters for the  appended  part  of
                       the output file name different for each file instead of
                       2 (using a _s_u_f_f_i_x_l_e_n_g_t_h of 3 will  create  files  named
                       xx_a_a_a–xx_z_z_z, and so forth).

       --bb _n[kk|mm]       Split  the file in pieces of _n bytes each.  If kk is ap‐
                       pended, _n is taken in kilobyte (1024-byte) units;  with
                       mm, in megabyte units.

       --ll _n            Split the file in pieces of _n lines each.

       --LL _r_e_g_e_x        Only  count lines containing the stated regular expres‐
                       sion (non-POSIX).
