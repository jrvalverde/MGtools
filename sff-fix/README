The program here simply changes the number of reads available in
an SFF file, and disables the indexes of the file by setting the
index fields in the header to zeroes. It does not remove the 
index itself nor any index-related headers.

To remove the index, the easiest way would be to use 'truncate(1)'
on the command line, using the offset reported by the program.
