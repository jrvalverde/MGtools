Split a long sequence into smaller fragments. We may do it at random and
specify the coverage for the fragments. This is useful to simulate a
random shotgun of a pool of clonal sequences.

The fragments generated may later be mutated with EMBOSS msbar to the
desired level to simulate sequencing errors.
